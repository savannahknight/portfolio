<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in Logan, Utah. I am the youngest in the family with two older sisters and one older brother. I attended Mountain Crest High School and was actively involved in student council, cross country, and many other clubs. After graduating high school in 2016, I started studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I hope to continue my education after graduating from BYU by obtaining a Masters in Business Administration. In my free time, I love rock clilmbing, skiing, playing the piano, and being with friends. </p>
